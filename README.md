## About the project

This page was made for the "Restaurant Page" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

The page was meant to showcase the DOM manipulation and webpack skills learned so far, it's fully responsive and was built using CSS for styling and Javascript for the structure and other dynamic features.

You can test the demo [here.](https://jgoldenusr.github.io/5.Restaurant-page/)
